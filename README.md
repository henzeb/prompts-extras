This package offers additional functionalities that expand upon Laravel's
Prompt. While these features may not be universally desired, they could
prove valuable for specific use cases.

Just like Laravel Prompts, you don't need the Laravel framework to use this
package.

The name is derived from `Busybox Extras` which has additional functionalities
for `BusyBox`, which is a single binary containing a lot of unix utilities for
resource-constrained environments.
